    <p class="serviceSummary">Our automatic wash is one of the few remaining "Full-Service" washes in the area with attendants on-duty.&nbsp; Our attendants hand wash and prep your auto before and during the automatic wash to make sure your auto comes out sparkling clean. If your ride does not come out clean, we will re-wash it for free. Attendants are also available to assist with folding in mirrors, removing antennas and guiding you safely in and out of the automatic wash. Our automatic wash uses low spin, non-scratch, soft shammies and our attendants use ultra soft hand brushes. In addition, special cleaning solutions and top of the line Simonize soap and wax are used to remove the toughest road scum and to add a layer of protection over your auto.</p>
